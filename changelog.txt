Additions:
Added the ability to individually configure each dimension's void
Added the ability to choose target dimension: You can now configure it to go overworld to nether, nether to end, etc.
Added more ways to spawn after falling in to the void:
- Appear at a safe, nearby position in the target world (Previous behavior, default)
- Fall from the sky in a similar position
- Appear on the surface at a similar position
- Appear at the world's spawnpoint
Added slow falling after teleport - can also be configured.

Fixes/Internal Changes:
Fixed the teleport getting spammed when it has difficulty finding a good spawn position or otherwise takes more than a tick to happen
