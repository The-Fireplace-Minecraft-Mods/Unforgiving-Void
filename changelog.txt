Updated to 1.16.2
Rewrite for Fabric
Improved stability and changed behaviors:
- The infinite teleporting bug should finally be dead
- The player will no longer fall after entering the nether, instead they will spawn on a solid block.
- The player is able to spawn in lava, so they are given fire resistance for long enough that they can get to safety, 3 minutes by default.
